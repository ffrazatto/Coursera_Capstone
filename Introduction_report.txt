Business Problem:

In 2012, the song "Gangnam Style" by the Psy, was the first YouTube video to achieve 1 billion views, it was one of the many hits that the K-Pop music genre would produce throughout the years. It have been 8 years since than and the rise of K-Pop has levered the interest in  South Korea's culture worldwide.

As this interest does not seems to be slowing, it would be interesting to explore the viability of opening a Korean Barbecue restaurant in a Brazilian city.

But some questions must be answered first: are there any interest in South Korean culture in Brazil, specially in SÃ£o Paulo state? Would it have too much competition or almost none for this restaurant category? And, most importantly, where would be a great place to open it?
