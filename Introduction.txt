Business Problem:

In 2012, the song "Gangnam Style' by Psy, was the first YouTube video to achieve 1 billion views, it was one of the many hits that the K-Pop music genre
would produce thoughout the years. It have been 8 years since than and the rise of K-Pop has levered the interest in  South Korea's culture worldwide.
As this interest does not seems to be slowing, it would be interesting to explore the viability of opening a Korean Barbecue restaurant in a Brazilian
city.

But some questions must be answered first: are there any interest in South Korean culture in Brazil, specially in São Paulo state? Would it be too much
competition or almost none for this restaurant category? And, most importatly, where would be a great place to open it?

To answer these questions I will first use Google Trends to measure the popularity of some relevant South Korean terms, and to find out about venue
distribution on Barão Geraldo, a district from Campinas, São Paulo, I will use an free API named 'CEP Aberto' to acquire neighborhood geolocations
and Foursquare's API for venue infomation.

Brazil's Postal Code Addressing, or CEP, is a system created in 1971 to facilitate the mail distribution, but, til this day, it lacks an associated 
geolocation system. It is extremely difficult to find this information, and what information is available is charged by Brazil's Postal Service.
Because of this, the most difficult task will be mine each CEP geolocation and associate it with it's neighborhood.
